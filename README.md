NOT EVEN CLOSE TO PRODUCTION READY.


This repo is an Attempt to Open source a tool I made for a client a long time ago. Unfortunatly time was short for
that client so I made a lot of site specific shortcuts and the code *really* got away from me in the end. BUT it
works on that site. Now we just need to make it work on all sites!

Work to do:

Make it work!
Review all todos and fix.
Clean up the DateItemGranularProcessor.php class (This is where the majority of the logic is and where it got away
me the most. Needs a lot of work.)
General code clean up (line by line probably! Lots could be done a lot better.
Add tests.
